<p>There are probably thousands of definitions and connotations of the word &#8220;spiritual.&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard some people say that they&#8217;re &#8220;spiritual but not religious.&#8221; I&#8217;ve also heard a Unitarian Universalist mention that she was &#8220;religious but not spiritual&#8221; on a YouTube video (1). The words &#8220;spiritual&#8221; and &#8220;religious&#8221; are often used interchangeably, but in my opinion, there are some clear distinctions.</p>
<p><b>Religion vs. Spirituality</b></p>
<p>Religion typically conveys some kind of congregation organized around a set of unifying ideals and rules of operation. It&#8217;s a public entity rather than a personal worldview. A religion  is a cultural institution, not a personal experience of the sublime.</p>
<p>Spirituality, on the other hand, seems like more of an individualistic and private matter. I&#8217;ve spoken with fellow atheists/agnostics who don&#8217;t consider themselves spiritual. By that, I assume that they meant that they lack a belief in supernatural phenomenon. In this sense, &#8220;spiritual&#8221; is synonymous with &#8220;magical,&#8221; and &#8220;magical&#8221; is synonymous with &#8220;delusional&#8221; or &#8220;irrational.&#8221; The trouble with this understanding of spirituality is that it throws the baby out with the bath water. By balking at any mention of spiritual experience, a hardcore atheist may err on the side of impoverishing the human experience.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a hardcore atheist/naturalist can form a rational basis for spirituality that&#8217;s consistent with modern science and humanist sensibilities.</p>
<p><b>Getting to the Root</b></p>
<p>The word &#8220;spirituality&#8221; is derived from the Latin root, &#8220;spirare&#8221; which literally means &#8220;to breathe&#8221; (2). Interestingly, the breath is a central object of meditation in Buddhist tradition, and also, a convenient philosophical tool to illustrate our interdependent and transient nature as living things (4).</p>
<p>There is a significant relationship between breath and conscious life (i.e. &#8220;spirit,&#8221; if you like). Human beings aren&#8217;t separate from nature, but instead, are an interdependent part of nature. Breathing is a simple example of this. It&#8217;s a physical exchange of matter between our bodies and our environment. And just like living creatures, each breath has its own lifespan and uniqueness in time and space. A breath has a limited duration, but it&#8217;s ultimately composed of the same matter it was before it was &#8220;born&#8221; and after it &#8220;dies.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Modernizing the Definition</b></p>
<p>In order to modernize spirituality, we need to give it a standalone definition apart from religious and supernatural connotations. We live in a post-Enlightenment world where science and reason provide the soundest answers to how our universe works. Our notions of spirituality should also be consistent with modern science. What isn&#8217;t consistent is the idea that consciousness is separate from the brain.</p>
<p>There is little compelling evidence that the human spirit is an immaterial phenomenon, so it makes sense to think of it as the culmination of neural activity sufficient to produce consciousness. In that sense, a spiritual experience could be just about any human experience. Does that render spirituality meaningless? Not necessarily.</p>
<p>The capacity to be aware of things is itself an awe-inspiring phenomenon, and because it encompasses all people, each person will have a unique take on the universe through his or her own subjective experience. Spirituality, is therefore very diverse, but at the same time, ubiquitous and unifying. Across cultures and borders, people have always been moved by the beauty of nature, the love of their fellow humans, and the capacity to create and reason and achieve great things (3).</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, what is spirituality in this modern sense of the word?</p>
<p>I think it comes down to this: the capacity for a conscious being to appreciate the beauty of existence.</p>
