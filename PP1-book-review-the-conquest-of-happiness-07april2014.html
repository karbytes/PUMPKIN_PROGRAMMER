<i>The Conquest of Happiness</i> is Bertrand Russell&#8217;s account of what makes for a happy life. Although it was written in 1930, the wisdom within it is timeless. The theme of taking an interest in something greater than oneself is especially relevant to today’s hyper-individualistic culture.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning, Russell talks briefly about his early life and his motivation for writing the book. &#8220;My purpose is to suggest a cure for the ordinary day-to-day unhappiness from which most people in civilized countries suffer (5, Russell).&#8221; Russell was familiar with the kind of unhappiness he describes. Although he lived in an affluent household, he struggled with severe depression while growing up. Preoccupied with his perceived inadequacies, he battled the urge to kill himself. &#8220;In adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which I was restrained by a desire to know more mathematics (5 &#8211; 6, Russell).&#8221; Russell&#8217;s hunger to understand subjects beyond his own opinion of himself lead him out of the gloom and into a brighter existence. &#8220;Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection (6, Russell).&#8221; His immersion in &#8220;impersonal interests&#8221; and concern for the well-being of others is a major theme throughout the book (and throughout his own life).
</p>
<p>
The first half of the book pertains to causes of unhappiness (e.g. envy, self-denigration, fear of holding an unpopular opinion) while the second half focuses on causes of happiness (e.g. enjoyment of mundane experience, family, impersonal interests). Below are a few of my favorite quotes from the book; quotes that exemplify a wise and happy attitude towards life:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#8220;The habit of looking to the future and thinking that the whole meaning of the present lies in what it will bring forth is a pernicious one. There can be no value in the whole unless there is value in the parts (17, Russell).&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Affection in the sense of a genuine reciprocal interest for two persons in each other, not solely as a means to each other&#8217;s good, but rather as a combination having a common good, is one of the most important elements of real happiness&#8230;(128, Russell).&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;To be happy in this world, especially when youth is past, it is necessary to feel oneself not merely an isolated individual whose day will soon be over, but part of the stream of life flowing on from the first germ to the remote an unknown future (138, Russell).&#8221;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A common thread throughout the book is fostering a connection to the larger world. This might all sound obvious, but it&#8217;s a message that really needs to be lived out to be appreciated. As someone who has struggled with social anxiety most of her life, I personally know how debilitating isolation and shyness can be.  Fortunately, I have learned from my own experiences about the importance of this human need to connect to something greater than oneself. It&#8217;s truly a message for our times. We never evolved to be isolated little nodes.
</p>
<p>
This lovely little book puts a lot of what I have learned (and am still learning) into words. Thank you, Bertrand Russell, for distilling such a beautiful message and for your invaluable contributions to science and philosophy.
