<p>It&#8217;s been over a year since I began this website. It started off as a simple WordPress.com blog with a pre-made template. Then it evolved into an independently hosted site with a custom theme that I hacked together. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about web development because of this site, and now, I&#8217;m ready to move onto the next big project.

Because of my busy work and school schedule, I will no longer be producing YouTube tutorials on programming. This will be the final post I add to Pumpkin Programmer, but don&#8217;t worry. This site will remain live!

Sometime later this year, my new website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420014917/http://www.karlina-bytes.com/" target="_blank">Karlina Bytes</a>, will go live. I&#8217;m really excited to start this new adventure.
